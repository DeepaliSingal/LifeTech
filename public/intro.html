            Don't you think that our life is revolving around technologies just like planets are revolving around sun. Everyday we get to hear a different news about technology either we have discovered a new tech or just arguments with different plots whether this tech will prove a bliss or boon. With so much increase of tech in our life i think everybody must have a basic knowledge of technical things happenening around us. This is the platform where you can get to know about various technologies which are not completely developed but can create a revolution of the society once got in movement. Here you can find technologies which are not much talked about. And not only about technologies but also we are gonna focus on a very important aspect called <em>AI(Artificial Intelligence)</em>. Sounding cool right? 
        </p>
        <p id="para2">
            Here you can also head to discussion forum and find the views of others in that technology. We can get both favourable and opposite views for that tech. 
            You will get a separate collection of views on how can this tech be beneficual or destructive. You can also add your opinion if you find it diffewrent from previously added reviews by using github repo for this project.
        </p>

            You can also find all the codes associated with this in the github repo.
