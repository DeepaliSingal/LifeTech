        How can AI be used in constructive manner?

        <p id="para1">
            There’s a great deal of concern over artificial intelligence; what it means for our jobs, whether robots will one day replace us in the workplace, whether it will one day lead to robot wars.
<br>
But current research projects show that artificial intelligence (AI) can also be used for the greater good. Here are five global problems that machine learning could help us solve.

            <ul id="list">
                <li>
                    <b>Healthcare</b>
                    <br>
                    “The discovery gives ALS researchers new insights that will pave the way for the development of new drug targets and therapies to combat one of the world's most devastating and deadly diseases.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b> Making driving safer</b>
                    <br>
                    “The increased comfort and decreased cognitive load with self-driving cars and shared transportation may affect where people choose to live,”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Transforming how we learn</b>
                    <br>
                    People learn differently, at different speeds and with different starting points. Artificial intelligence could usher in a future where we all learn in a much more personalised way. But no education system in the world can afford a tutor for every child, so this is where AI might be able to step in.
