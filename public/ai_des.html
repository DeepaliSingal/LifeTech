        Can AI be destructive?
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Thereâ€™s a great deal of concern over artificial intelligence; what it means for our jobs, whether robots will one day replace us in the workplace, whether it will one day lead to robot wars.

            The dangers of artificial intelligence have been exposed on various fronts. One interesting thing about the issues with AI is that there are a number of movies that provide classic examples of what would happen if it went wrong.

                    <br>
                    Artificial Intelligence may seem like an autonomous program but at the backend, there is someone managing and handling it to ensure proper performance.

                    <b>In Case the Program Takes a Negative Approach Towards a Positive Outcome</b>
                    <br>
                    Hollywood movies like Avengers; Age of Ultron and Eagle Eye try to lend a practical perspective to the idea and a system capable of this much autonomy will ultimately be able to make decisions as it deems fit.

                    Data has become the most valuable currency these days. Even with narrow or no AI, organizations keep records of user information to help target them more effectively.It only begs the question that with AI in place, where will its moral compass lie and to what extent it will go to collect data and track people in the name of surveillance.
